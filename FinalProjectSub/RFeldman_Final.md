## Mystical Environment (MEnvironment)

>Project Title

## Project Abstract

>The Project is made up of four parts. The 3D Game Kit Lite Provided by Unity Learn will function as the base set of pieces that will be modified and changed as needed. 
My major objective is to create a unique open world space for a player to explore. This will include the four major project parts. First, I will learn Unity's
Terrain System in order to create a large environment as a setpiece landscape with assistance from AI-generated concept art. Second, I will learn how to greybox and use 
ProBuilder via Unity Learn and create a custom level/edit exist material. Second, I will learn how to do Lighting via Unity Learn's Lighting Unit in Creative Core to 
create a focused, condensed space containing lighting assets. Fourth, I will learn how to create Audio sources within Unity via the Unit in Creative Core to populate the level 
with ambient sound effects.

## Project Reflection

>This class has exposed me to game engines on a more intricate level for the first time. Because of this, I feel as though Unity is a very cumbersome game engine, where many aspects seem to be done better within other pieces of software. The number of times we explored a piece of Unity’s toolkit as a class or I explored a tool on my own which was followed up with how another engine (such as unreal) executed on the tool better was noteworthy. Simultaneously, Unity’s package manager makes collecting tools to use extremely easy, and I appreciate its existence every time I’m using a package.
>This experience has definitely made me feel more proficient with both general software as well as Unity, since this was my first true deep dive into an established game engine. Most of the games I made previously were physical games or modded versions of existing games. While my project is intended to be a collection of skills from areas I am familiar with, I feel as though the process of bringing all of these assets together has opened the door for me to feel more confident exploring areas I am not familiar with in order to implement them into future projects, such as scripting (to name one example).
>My big ‘aha moment’ from this project was the slow realization that my project would be entirely made up of Prefabs and Prefab Variants. Unity’s Prefab system is incredibly useful for creating variance in objects very quickly. Realizing I could take one baked light and implement it in prefabs in order to edit it on the fly and bake all my new lights later was an incredible timesaver. I used prefabs in every aspect of my project except for the actual terrain sculpting and I am grateful this system exists.
>I really appreciated being able to speak to industry professionals about how projects like these actually play out. Everytime John Shull or Francois Roughol answered a question, it felt like a gold mine of information was being washed away down a river and I was just trying to retain as much as possible.
>A simple piece of feedback on the class as a whole would be that I wish we had started digging into individual project issues sooner. I feel like it would have been a nice supplement to the usual lectures to see how elements we previously discussed were playing out in practice. I also feel as though it would have relieved a certain amount of unnecessary concern I had early on regarding whether or not I was actually capable of achieving what I planned to do.
>I think the parts of my project that I am most proud of are the custom audio assets I made and the terrain sculpting I did. Those are the parts I feel I did the best quality work on. I am also proud of the fact that I landed the plane in the end. I am a pretty experienced planner, but I can never predict every wrench that will be thrown into my plans. A lot of the work may have happened in a shorter than ideal period of time, but I am happy to have met the most important deadlines.

## Project Next Steps

>If I were to continue work on this project, I would add more density in detail to the ruins environment in the form of additonal 
3d Models, Lighting, and Audio. I would look into adding some basic scripts to create more advanced audio effects (different trigger types).
I would also add more interactive elements, such as enemies to fight, or gameplay reasons to encourage players to explore beyond the ruins.
