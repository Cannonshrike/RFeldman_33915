# GAME 395 CRN: 23699 ChangeLog Folder

This is where you can keep a high level changelog of your project process. I am suggesting you use [Keep A ChangeLog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) to create your changelog.

## Notes

Changelogs are used in all sorts of different capacities. A lot of more advanced and larger teams setup their changelog automatically from commits and pull requests. For smaller teams this is something that is generally curated during milestones and/or major versions. It's to help provide information internally and externally (if you're running your material via open source framework)
