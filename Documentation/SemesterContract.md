This is your contract, also known as a PULSE Check document. **P**rogressing **U**pward **L**earning & **S**elf-**E**valuating. This system is based around two progress check-in with an optional one in the middle of the semester. It's tied to a learning cycle that deals with concrete experiences, reflective observation, abstract hypothesis, and active testing <sup>1</sup>.

## Project Idea

>**PROJECT DETAILS**
>
>The game will be a 3rd person exploration game set in a mystical environment. The project will  prioritize making interesting locations for the player to explore using elements such as sound design, terrain/environments, and player movement options. The main goals are to create a playable 3D game/experience; and learn how to implement files I have created into a fully functional game/experience. I am going to focus in on audio and terrain: I have experience making sounds/composing music, so I would like to learn how to leverage this experience in Unity and I have experience in environmental design in programs such as Twinmotion/Unreal, and would like to learn how to create terrain in Unity. Secondary pieces of the project are going to be tied to event systems and things like player movement options for the project and lighting as I have experience working with lighting in 3D environments, and would like to learn how to do lighting in Unity.

### Unity Learn Pathway

Unity has great resources for their [Unity Learn platform](https://learn.unity.com/). A major portion of this class is utilizing those services, please identify which Unity Learn Pathway you want to explore and then how that pathway could help lead towards a potential certification opportunity later after this class.

>**Based on Creative Core with a Focus on 3D World Building and Audio**
>
> Hey Ryan: In this area write out your unity learn plan. You should expect to put roughly 30-40 hours in towards the Unity Learn system. Given your general 3D concept and where this is going as long as this Unity Learn content targets things like URP, audio generation, 3D assets, lighting, terrain, and/or what I would call generic Unity events (input system / physics events etc.) you're going to be good to go as that covers your goals. I would also look into Unity Learn Content tied to Unity Probuilder and Unity Polybrush as that's going to be really helpful for setting up your space without having to flush out every single detail in your world and feel free to throw in some tutorials on good sound capture, audio creation, and/or good foley practice...
