# GAME 395 CRN: 33915

This is a template repository setup by John Shull on behalf of **NAME**

## Student Project Repository

The most important document in this repository is the SemesterContract.md file, it's located in the [Documentation/SemesterContract.md](./Documentation/SemesterContract.md) and has been custom tailored to our first one-on-one meeting. From here on out this repository and this file are maintained between John Shull and **NAME** - both parties are responsible for the management of this repository and making sure that all items are addressed for the deliverable by the end of the class period.

## Submission Templates

There will be multiple times you will be updating your repository for review and feedback as we are working on this together. The first one will be February 13th. Please see the [Documentation/ProjectProposal.md](./Documentation/ProjectProposal.md) for the template you need to work on towards submission.

## Notes

Feel free to update and use this readme in any format as you see fit. As you complete items that are to align with your grading agreement update the documentation and provide support/reference to those completion status. This is an ever-evolving process and this will be your repository when it's all done - so make it reflect that!
