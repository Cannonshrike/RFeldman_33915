# Game 395 Project Proposal and Project Review

Overall this document is to provide initial feedback for the project plan. See the sections below for additional information by the main documents and at the end find a section of specific issues/items to finish before getting the project approved.

## Answers to Questions

>First, what is required of me involving the Event Presentation High Stakes Assignment?
>
This is just you attending and/or participating in some sort of external/community based event that deals with either 'games' and/or something Unity specific. For example: Unity has upcoming events through their [event-hub](https://unity.com/events-hub) and you could just attend onf that is online and that would count (There's some sort of Webinar running from 2-16 thru 3-9 dealing with Multiplayer games). There's no proof of doing this other than I might ask you to reflect about the event at the end of the class in your final project submission.
> Second, I could have glossed over it, but I am unsure if any of my current Unity Learn Plan contains Polybrush. I will double-check, but some insight on where to find at least a little may be helpful.
>
Polybrush is nice but if you already familiar with other 3D sculpting/mesh software like ZBrush or Blender/Maya you might want to stick the them. ProBuilder is more useful for scene layout work and PolyBrush could be helpful here for quick stuff in Unity but again if you know how to use ZBrush I wouldn't mess too much with PolyBrush. PolyBrush has some useful features when it comes to some of the ways you can scatter existing models around another surface but still if you have previous experience with something like ZBrush just stick with ZBrush. PolyBrush still can be a great resource to be aware of and can help in a pinch of time so it usually gets lumped together with ProBuilder.

## The Proposal Document & General Overview

**How well does this connect back to GitHub project plan, the contract, and the learn tutorials.**

Hey Ryan- I think your semester contract is good and I think your proposal document is very much right on in focus. By forcing yourself to hone in on environment and then layering in pieces that go along like audio work and obviously lighting you're setting yourself up for stages/milestones along the way that just work well and directly correlate to environment building. My initial suggestions that I go into more detail below are more tied to just sequencing and/or making sure you don't wait until the end to start to put in some work that builds towards your portfolio. I wish most proposals where this straight to the point. I think what might be worth your time exploring is sort of the balance between when and where you want to use an engine tool like ProBuilder for scene grey/white boxing vs an external mesh creation tool like Maya. I personally think you should stick to the fundamentals in which you work up some concept drawings and/or sketches of your environment while you're working through some of the Unity Essential classes and before you dive into ProBuilder and building out sections you have a concept in mind that is already flushed out. You can always modify and add that to your contract as a portfolio piece if you want. I would then avoid some of the programming pieces and just use what you can from either the class and/or some of my packages that I have out - aka the FP_Controller gives you a complete 1st person sort of camera that you can 'walk' around your environment. I would stick with the Audio side and let the Junior programmer fall off. The other reason I mention this: it's my strong point so if you were to use some of my time throughout the project to help get some things 'working' for you it should be in those areas and then that lets you maximize your time towards environment and building out portfolio pieces. I also think it might be best for you not to use the 3D Game kit... unless you want to use their assets and/or some of their textures this is a pretty large overhead project and in your case just having a character controller to run around your environment doesn't need to be this specific Unity character. There is also the [3D Game Kit Lite](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/tutorials/3d-game-kit-lite-135162) which contains just the raw necessities to use the character and the controller and some of the other management content and not much of the assets. Just something to consider.

### Unity Versions & Packages

**Understanding of the current version, all of the Unity packages that will be potentially needed and/or used, and ideally showcasing initial attempts at setting this up**

This is something I have been chipping away at class and I might have not been clear on what I'm looking for. For example, each Unity Game Kit is in itself a bunch of other packages - I need a list of all of those by Unity version. I want you to go through them because in most cases even the full kits Unity provide - something gets messed up when going to a newer/older version of Unity. It's good practice and it helps me understand that you're at least aware of the Unity packages Unity is using within these templates. I would then just use the table format in Markdown to provide them in a list/order. The easiest way to do this - create a blank Unity project in your render pipeline like 3D Core URP - then open up the package manager and bring in all of the packages you're referencing via Unity Learn and just install them. See what sort of issues arise and in most cases none will.

## Contract Document

**Medium stake assignments align to their unity educational learn plan**

This looks like the original one we worked up - as long as you're okay with it!

## GitHub Project Plan

**Plan milestones align with pulse check requirements.**

Looks good - I would consider expanding out some of the details as you get more into them but at a high level you have a place to start and it aligns with your project.

## To get your Project Pull Request Approved

* Update your proposal to include the Unity Packages being used by the game kit and list those out in the proposal document in a table fashion as well as any other free/paid asset kits you're looking at if it's relevant to your project.
