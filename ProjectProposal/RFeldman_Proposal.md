# Game 395 Project Proposal CRN# 33915 Ryan Feldman

## Making a World and The Means to Explore It

## Project Abstract

>The Project is made up of four parts. The 3D Game Kit Provided by Unity Learn will function as the base set of pieces that will be modified and changed. 
My major objective is to create a unique open world space for a player to explore. This will include 3 of the four project parts. First, I will learn 
how to greybox and use ProBuilder via Unity Learn and create a custom level/edit exist material. Second, I will learn how to do Lighting via Unity Learn's 
Lighting Unit in Creative Core to create a focused, high density space, as well as larger, less dense lighting work for the rest of the level. Third, I 
will learn how to create Audio sources within Unity via the Unit in Creative Core to populate the level with ambient sound effects (alongside a dense area 
to display the same variance as Lighting). My Minor Objective is to edit the player's movement options, ideally using Unity's New Input System and some 
Programming in order to create three different movement mechanics for the player to use to traverse the world.


## Unity Project Version and Unity Packages

>I plan on using The 3D Game Kit suggested by John from Unity Learn as the baseline material for my project.
